book with edition, author and editor
Note that the standard BibTeX styles do not support book entries with both
author and editor fields, but IEEEtran.bst does.
The standard BibTeX way of specifying the edition is to use capitalized
ordinal words such as "First", "Second", etc. Most .bst files can convert
up to about "Fifth" into the format needed. IEEEtran.bst can convert up
to "Tenth" to the "Arabic ordinal" form IEEE uses (e.g., "10th"). For
editions over the tenth, it is best to use the "Arabic ordinal" form for
IEEE related work (e.g., "101st")
Note how "Jr." has to be entered.

a periodical
From the April 2001 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 160, reference #1.
sort key is needed for sorting styles
@periodical{IEEEexample:periodical,
  title         = IEEE_M_PCOM # ", Special Issue on Wireless {ATM}",

  month         = aug,
  year          = "1996",
  key           = "IEEE"
}





standard, IEEE does not use the address for standards, but it is good
to provide one for BibTeX styles that use it.
From the August 2001 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 451, reference #2.
@standard{IEEEexample:standard,
  title         = "Wireless {LAN} Medium Access Control {(MAC)} and 
                   Physical Layer {(PHY)} Specification",
  organization  = "IEEE",

  number        = "802.11",
  year          = "1997"
}


standard with type and revision, the type overrides the word standard
(or std.). Here a standard number is not available and a revision number
is used.
From the August 2000 issue of "IEEE Photonics Technology Letters",
page 1048, reference #13.
@standard{IEEEexample:standardproposed,
  title         = "Fiber Channel Physical Interface ({FC-PI})",

standard draft as a misc with author
From the May 2002 issue of "IEEE Journal of Selected Areas in
Communication", page 725, reference #16.

  title         = "{MATE}: {MPLS} Adaptive Traffic Engineering",
  howpublished  = "IETF Draft",
  year          = "1999"
}





misc for a techreport like reference
techreport is not perfectly suitable because this entry lacks
an institution field
From the August 2001 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 490, reference #22.
@misc{IEEEexample:miscforum,
  author        = "L. Roberts",
  title         = "Enhanced Proportional Rate Control Algorithm {PRCA}",
  howpublished  = "{ATM} Forum Contribution 94-0735R1",
  month         = aug,
  year          = "1994"
}


misc for a white paper
From the August 2001 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 478, reference #4 - Note that the reference there (improperly?)
used the author field for "Cisco".
@misc{IEEEexample:whitepaper,
  title         = "Advanced {QoS} Services for the Intelligent Internet",

Other unusual references

a private communication as a misc entry type
sometimes the designation "personal communication" is used instead
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1725, reference #16.
@misc{IEEEexample:private,
  author        = "S. Konyagin",
  howpublished  = "private communication",
  year          = "1998"
}


an internet request for comments (RFC) as a misc entry type
It would also be nice to add a URL to these types of things.
RFCs can also be handled as electronic references.
From the April 2002 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 181, reference #14.
@misc{IEEEexample:miscrfc,
  author        = "K. K. Ramakrishnan and S. Floyd",
  title         = "A Proposal to Add Explicit Congestion
                   Notification ({ECN}) to {IP}",
  howpublished  = "RFC 2481",
  month         = jan,
  year          = "1999"
}


a software package as a manual
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE/ASME Journal of Microelectromechanical
Systems", page 205, reference #20.
Sometimes they put the version/release information in the title.
@manual{IEEEexample:softmanual,
  title         = "SaberDesigner Reference Manual",
  organization  = "Analogy, Inc.",
  address       = "Beaverton, OR",
  year          = "1998",
  note          = "Release 4.3"
}


a software package as an electronic reference
From the February 2003 issue of  "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 46, reference #24. If there is no author or organization, a sorting
key is required for sorting styles. It might be a good idea to include
month and year fields as well.
@electronic{IEEEexample:softonline,
  title         = "Ucb/lbnl/vint Network Simulator---ns (Version 2)",
  url           = "http://www-mash.cs.berkeley.edu/ns/",
  key           = "ns"
}


misc for a German regulation
In German, the first letters of nouns are capitalized, so we do so here.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Journal in Selected Areas in
Communication", page 892, reference #9.
@misc{IEEEexample:miscgermanreg,
  title         = "{M}essung von {S}t{\"o}rfeldern an {A}nlagen 
                   und {L}eitungen der {T}elekommunikation im
                   {F}requenzbereich 9 {kHz} bis 3 {GHz}",
  language      = "german",
  howpublished  = "{M}e{\ss}vorschrift {R}eg {TP} {MV} 05",
  organization  = "Regulierungsbeh{\"o}rde f{\"u}r {T}elekommunikation und
                   {P}ost ({R}eg {TP})"
}



Ways to handle things like CCSDS's Blue Books
journal article with a URL. However, this is not a very good approach
because the Blue Books are not really journals and the author field has
to be abused.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1461, reference #7.
@article{IEEEexample:bluebookarticle,
  author        = "{Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)}",
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  journal       = "Blue Book",
  number        = "4",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}


CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a book
However, it is not a good idea to have to use the author field for
an organization (done here because the book entry type requires an
author field).
@book{IEEEexample:bluebookbook,
  author        = "{Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)}",
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  series        = "Blue Book",
  number        = "4",
  publisher     = "{CCSDS}",
  address       = "Newport Beach, {CA}",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}


CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a manual
This is a much better approach, but uses the howpublished field.
@manual{IEEEexample:bluebookmanual,
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  howpublished  = "ser. Blue Book, No. 4",
  organization  = "Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)",
  address       = "Newport Beach, CA",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}



CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a standard
Probably the best approach for this particular case because the work
is standard related. Note that IEEE does not display the address for
standards.
@standard{IEEEexample:bluebookstandard,
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  howpublished  = "ser. Blue Book, No. 4",
  organization  = "Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)",
  address       = "Newport Beach, CA",
  type          = "Recommendation for Space Data System Standard",
  number        = "101.0-B-4",
  month         = May,
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}








An example of a IEEEtran control entry which can change some IEEEtran.bst
settings. An entry like this must be cited via \bstctlcite{} command
before the first real \cite{}. The same entry key cannot be called twice
(just like multiple \cite{} of the same entry key place only one entry
in the bibliography.)
The available control fields are:

CTLuse_article_number
"no" turns off the display of the number for articles.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_paper
"no" turns off the display of the paper and type fields in inproceedings.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_forced_etal 
"no" turns off the forced use of "et al."
"yes" enables

CTLmax_names_forced_etal
The maximum number of names that can be present beyond which an "et al."
usage is forced. Be sure that CTLnames_show_etal (below)
is not greater than this value!

CTLnames_show_etal
The number of names that will be shown with a forced "et al.".
Must be less than or equal to CTLmax_names_forced_etal

CTLuse_alt_spacing 
"no" turns off the alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs.
"yes" enables

CTLalt_stretch_factor
If alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs is enabled, this is
the interword spacing stretch factor that will be used. For example, the
default "4" here means that the interword spacing in entries with URLs can
stretch to four times normal. Does not have to be an integer.

CTLdash_repeated_names
"no" turns off the "dashification" of repeated (i.e., identical to those
of the previous entry) names. IEEE normally does this.
"yes" enables

CTLname_format_string
The name format control string as explained in the BibTeX style hacking
guide.
IEEE style "{f.~}{vv~}{ll}{, jj}" is the default,

CTLname_latex_cmd
A LaTeX command that each name will be fed to (e.g., "\textsc").
Leave empty if no special font is desired for the names.
The default is empty.

CTLname_url_prefix
The prefix text used before URLs.
The default is "[Online]. Available:" A space will be inserted after this
text. If this space is not wanted, just use \relax at the end of the
prefix text.


Those fields that are not to be changed can be left out.
